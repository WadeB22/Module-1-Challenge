# FinTech Bootcamp Module 1 Challenge (FinTech Case Study - ConsenSys - Wade Burgess)

## Overview and Origin

* ConsenSys was founded in October 2014 by Joseph Lubin, is based in New York City, and is believed to have exceeded $100M of revenue in 2021.

* Lubin was the most experienced of Ethereum's original eight co-founders, and his deep pockets helped keep the fledgling block-chain based platform afloat in the early days.

* "“We started with the toughest thing—the public permissionless blockchain, where anybody could attach byzantine environments. We solved that problem in effectively a not very scalable way, but it’s turning out to be remarkably scalable because we can build interesting solutions at layer two. This basic trust foundation so revolutionized trust on the planet, from subjective trust to automated trust, and guaranteed execution of agreements or objective trust upon that layer, that we’re now building what looks like the financial plumbing for the emerging decentralized economy.” - Joseph Lubin

* When it was decided to make Ethereum a nonprofit in 2014, Lubin was already planning to create a for-profit business focused on the platform's application layer.

* The company announced a $450M Series D round on March 15, 2022, at a $7B valuation, doubling it's value since it's previous round in November 2021.  This brought the total capital raised by the company to $725M over 6 rounds.


## Business Activities

* "The ConsenSys product suite leverages blockchain to address long-standing industry problems across tradtional finance, decentralized finance, commerce and trade." (consensys.net)

* One recent specific example of the company addressing industry problems is partnering with Mastercard when rolling out ConsenSys Rollups in late 2021, allowing software developers to increase scale, efficiency and speed of transactions on various  blockchains, not just Ethereum. 

* The increased scalability and confidentiality for asset transfers acheived by ConsenSys Rollups enables new, innovative use-cases such as Central Bank digital currencies, decentralized exchanges, micropayments, private transfer and taxes.

* One key product driving the company's success is MetaMask, a digital wallet for managing, transferring and receiving ETH and other approved tokens.

* MetaMask was created in 2016 with the goal of making access to the Ethereum blockchain easy, reliable, and secure.  Achieving that goal has made MetaMask one of the most trusted and highly used cyrpto wallets in the industry, with over 30 million monthly active users.

* Money magazine chose MetaMask as the best wallet for Ethereum in September 2022 "because its user-friendly interface provides quick and easy access to thousands of tokens and decentralized apps witnin the Ethereum network."

* ConsenSys and its various products and solutions are trusted and utilized by both the smallest of startups as well as some of the world's largest companies including AWS, P&G, Hitachi, Microsoft, Bank of Korea, and Reserve Bank of Australia, just to name a few.

* The company utilizes too many technologies too list, but they include Java, Python, Bootstrap, Fastly, Golang, GitHub Pages, Netlify, and Varnish. 

## Landscape

* ConsenSys' primary domains are blockchain infrastructures and cryptocurrency, specifically Ethereum focused.

* One significant trend in this domain is the birth of the Metaverse, in which the company is again a key player in facilitating participation. 

* "In simple words, Metaverse is a 3D universe where several virtual ecosystems connect to form a bigger cluster. Users can play, communicate, and work together in these 3D spaces. Metaverse is a combination of Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, and Blockchain Technology. It is more than just a virtual space as it incorporates various technical elements within it which are yet to be disclosed. Platforms like Decentraland, Axie Infinity, SecondLife, etc. are the examples highlighting the integration of blockchain technology and Metaverse. Cryptocurrencies help to build a digital economy in which investors can use tokens and assets in various purposeful means." (blockchain-council.org Aug 25, 2022)

* Another significant trend is the expansion of Blockchain as a Service (BaaS).  The largest tech companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and IBM are all jumping into the BaaS pool with both feet.  ConsenSys has already established itself as one of the key players in this area.

* The amount of money flowing into this space is proof the investment community believes solidly in a future where blockchain technologies are vital.

* KPMG reported that investment in crypto and blockchain exceeded $30B in 2021, far eclipsing the prior three years combined ($8.2B, $5.6B and $5.5B in 2018, 2019, 2020 respectively).

* Other major companies in the space, besides ones previously mentioned, include Bitcoin Co, Chainalysis Inc, Ripple Labs Inc, Custom Software Development Co, R3 LLC and Block.one LLC.


## Results

* Lupin's presence as an early pioneer in the DeFi and blockchain technologies have led to him being a significant influence regarding the future of the domain.

* ConsenSys' early positioning as the most trusted and knowledgeable player, specifically relating to Ethereum, have positioned the company for continued success.  This is not only evidenced by the major global companies they have partnered with, but also by the $7B valuation as of their last raise. 

* ConsenSys' impact and metrics can be closely tied to Ethereum's success and adoption in general, as the company focuses on making it easy for others to build applications on Ethereum and participate in DeFi, NFTs, DAOs and the metaverse.

* Ethereum's adoption success was summed up by DeFiprime.com, a media outlet and analytical services provider for the DeFi community, who in 2019 stated "We have 216 DeFi projects listed and 191 of them built on Ethereum." This compares to 20 built on Bitcoin and 13 on EOS DeFi.

* Related to the success rate of one of the company's key products, MetaMask, the company saw its monthly active users grow from 545K in July 2020 to 10.4M in Aug 2021, an 1,800% increase in one year.  This positioned MetaMask as the leading non-custodial wallet by users globally.  The number of monthly active users is now over 30M, demonstrating continued success.


## Recommendations

* One specific recommendation to ConsenSys I would make would be to "stay in their lane" when it comes to investing and focus.  

* In 2018, the company acquired Planetary Resources for an undisclosed amount.  This company attempted to develop and deploy asteroid mining technologies for the expansion of the Earth's natural resources.

* By 2020 Planetary Resources closed it business, presumbably losing ConsenSys its entire investment value.  Obviously this business had nothing to do with ConsenSys' core competencies, and can be assumed to have only been a distraction and waste of capital resources that would have been better used within the company's core focus.

* The company should continue to make it easier for others to adopt Ethereum as a platform to build upon, while further cementing themselves as the key player to lean on for products to incorporate into that growth.

* ConsenSys should also continue to break down cross-blockchain platform barriers.  Inter-platform applications will continue to be critical moving forward as applications become more wide-spread globally.
